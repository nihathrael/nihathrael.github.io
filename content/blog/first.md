Welcome to my blog! On this blog I'll be covering a variety of topics that interest me, mostly technical computer science related topics.

Topics I currently envision writing about:
* The Java programming langugae
* Performance Tuning (especially Java code)
* Management of IT Teams
* Maybe: Motorcycles & Sports

I hope you'll enjoy the content! If you ever have questions, get in touch on with me on my [Socials](/#socials).
